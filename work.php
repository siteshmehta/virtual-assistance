                                        Scheduling and resource planning: Creating a plan is important to set the project
                                        off on a successful path. The virtual project assistant will create a timeline with
                                        deadlines, assign tasks to the team, control time management, monitor progress,
                                        oversee quality control, provide feedback, and will make sure everything is
                                        successfully completed.

                                        Monitors cost estimates and develops the budget: Our virtual project assistant will
                                        understand the limits of a budget and importance of sticking to it. If a project is
                                        delivered as expected but goes over-budget, then it will still be considered a
                                        failure.
